# rotate_compare_mediapipe_data
 `.mlx` file that rotates mediapipe output, with a nested file that shows a quick first pass at comparing COM data (COM calculations rely on python code that isn't in this repo, but I have test files)

in order to use the rotation file, you'll need to provide your own mediapipe output, likely called `mediaPipeSkel_3d_smoothed.npy`. I can't upload that file because it's too big!
